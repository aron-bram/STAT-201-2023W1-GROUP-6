<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
We'll be investigating the question whether gender has any effect on the mean age of Olympic athletes in Football from the year 1900 onwards.
Our parameter of interest would be the difference of mean age in male and female football olympic athletes from 1900 onwards. As well as, the scale parameter that is useful in answering this question would be the standard deviation of age in male and female olympic athletes.

We were interested in this research question as, a previous study shows negative relationship between age and athletes performance in olympics. One study states that the declines in performance were more in females, but another study has found that delayed maturation has been observed in higher-skilled football athletes and differences within the sport in the relative age effect.
