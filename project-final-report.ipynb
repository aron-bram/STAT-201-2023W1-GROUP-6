    "The aim of this project is to analyze the historical data of Olympic athletes and their performance in various events. The data source for this project is the Kaggle dataset <a href = \"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results\">120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results</a>, which was obtained from the <a href = \" https://www.sports-reference.com/\">Sports Reference</a> (Forman, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 271116 records, each representing an individual athlete who participated in an Olympic event. The dataset has 15 attributes, ```ID```, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Team`, `NOC`, `Games`, `Year`, `Season`, `City`, `Sport`, `Event` & `Medal`. The dataset covers the period from 1896 to 2016 and includes both summer and winter Olympics.\n",

    "<h5>Research Question</h5>\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "We'll be investigating the question <b>whether gender has any effect on the mean age of Olympic athletes in Football from the year 1900 onwards.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We were interested in this research question as, a previous study shows negative relationship between age and athletes performance in olympics. Bongard V. in his study states that the declines in performance were more in females due to difference in physical development between men and women. As men gain more muscle mass after puberty, women experience more physical changes which alter the physics of their sport, requiring females to re-learn skills as they age (Bongard, V. et al., 2007). However, there is conflicting research which found that predominantly older female football athletes reached the highest levels of competition, thus calling into question whether youth is truly a determining factor in success of female competitors (Barreira et al., 2021) \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this uncertainity in the relationship between gender and age, our parameter of interest would be the difference of mean age in male and female football olympic athletes from 1900 onwards. As well as, the scale parameter that is useful in answering this question would be the variance of age in male and female olympic athletes."

    "The \"good thing\" about this report is the sample population we are using for the argument, `olympic football athletes` is sampled at random and unbiased fashion. Separating sports competition by gender is often regarded as one of the most controversial topics in the history of sports, especially with the recent rise and push for gender equality. Therefore by using this report, it directly reflects those competing at the highest levels, hence, those who are directly impacted by decision of gender affect on sports. As shown above, we were able to calculate the point estimate mean age, and produce graphs that help us visualize those point estimates that help us draw a relationship between the age and the olympic athletes in both genders.  We see some observed negative differences in Male and Female Athlete's mean & variance of age. However, we know nothing about the reliability of these results. \n",

    "We'll also contruct a 95% confidence interval of the difference in mean/variance and check if it contains 0. As for the confidence interval, the sample we are using is really large ($n = 600 > 50$). Therefore a 95% confidence interval should provide a fairly low margin of error, allowing us to prove that the estimates are reliable\n",

    "Choosing between bootstrapping and asymptotics depends on data characteristics and assumptions. Simulation-based methods, like bootstrapping, offer an advantage by not relying heavily on distribution assumptions. In cases of smaller sample sizes, simulation methods often yield more robust results, as theory-based methods may struggle with assumptions such as those required by the CLT. The decision depends on the specific sample size, and the ability to meet underlying assumptions. In situations with uncertain assumptions or smaller samples, simulation-based methods, particularly bootstrapping, may be a more reliable choice.\n",

This is a result of our sample being sufficiently large for both of these methods to be optimal. Therefore, I don't think anyone one of them is particularly more trustworthy than other."

    "Our report concludes that as our observed p-value for both the difference in mean and difference in variance  are highly statistically significant therefore,  we reject null hypotheses for each difference in mean and difference in variance. In conclusion, there exists a difference between the mean and variance of Olympic male football  athletes and female football athletes age from 1900 onwards. In other words, gender does seem to be an influencing factor in the mean age of Olympic football athletes.\n",

    "These findings counters the common narrative that female athletes have shorter career spans or younger prime ages than their male counterparts. Given the mixed conclusions of past literature on similar topics and the preliminary data visualizations (histogram and boxplot), we estimated that there would be a difference in mean age between the two genders, our findings did align with those expectations. \n",

    "This would help us conclude that age does in fact play a role in the performances of athletes for both genders. These findings could be used to argue that sport competitions should or shouldn’t be separated by both gender and age. Leading to some further questions like, Is there a relationship between the Weight Class and Gender for Olympic Football Athletes? Does Gender affect the likeliness of Olympic Football Athletes winning a medal?"
